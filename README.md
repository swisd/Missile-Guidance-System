# Missile-Guidance-System
Missile Guidance System based on 'The missile knows where it is at all times'

Main program: `missile_guidance_system_main.py`, 
Dev program: `mgs_dev_interface.py`

Run `runner.py` to perform setup actions. You might need to delete any subfolders of rNN as it will return an error.

`disklist.e.idl` files are used as a buffer for `rNN_H.py`.

Documentation for writing `.msl` files is provided in `assets/models/structure.txt`
